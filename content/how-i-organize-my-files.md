The Following is the Directory structure I use for organizing my life

```
inbox/
notes/
|
|--inbox.md
|--todo.txt
`--done.txt

projects/
|
|--project-1
`--project-2

notes/
|
|--inbox.md
|--todo.txt
`--done.txt

archive/
|
`--YYYY/
   |
   |--notes/
   `--projects/
      |--project-3
      `--project-4
```


## inbox
The inbox directory is pretty self explanatory, things land here when you aren't
quite sure what to do yet, or a place that a new project might start taking
form.

## notes
The notes directory notes are for thoughts, drafts, plans, and well notes. I
use plain text markdown files, since I appreciate the portability and
additional structure

## projects
a project is anything that ends up needing a document or requires a working
space. A projects name is not abbreviated, and if it's name is more than one
word they are separated by dashes e.g. some-project-name, other-project, thing

## archive
Every year gets a directory and after a year passes notes and projects
directories get moved into that years directory, and you create a new note and
project directories
