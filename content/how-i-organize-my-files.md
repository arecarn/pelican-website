The following is the directory structure I use for organizing my files for work
and projects, and life.

```
inbox/
notes/
|
|--inbox.md
|--todo.txt
`--done.txt

projects/
|
|--project_1
`--project_2

notes/
|
|
|--done.txt
|--home_project_1_note.md
|--work_project_2_note.md
|--inbox.md
|--todo.txt

archive/
|
`--YYYY/
   |
   |--notes/
   |  |--home_project_3_note.md
   |  `--work_project_4_note.md
   |
   `--projects/
      |--project_3
      `--project_4
```


## inbox
The inbox directory is pretty self explanatory, things land here when you aren't
quite sure what to do yet, or a place that a new project might start taking
form.

## notes
The notes directory notes are for thoughts, drafts, plans, and well notes. For
my notes I mostly use plain text markdown files. There are other markup
languages that are better specified and more powerful, but I appreciate the
ubiquity and simplicity of markdown.

## projects
A project is anything that ends up needing a requires a working space. A
projects name is not abbreviated, and if it's name is more than one word they
are separated by underscores e.g. some_project_name, other_project, thing

## archive
So thing don't get to cluttered, every year a new archive directory with the
year as its name get gets created, with a projects and notes directory inside
it. When a project is finished or becomes inactive it can be moved to the
projects directory in the archive. For notes I usually wait till the end of the
year and move all notes that I'm done with to the archive.
