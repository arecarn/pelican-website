#### Software
I am a software craftsman who enjoys the creative puzzle that is creating
software. I care deeply about producing high quality software that works, is
readable, and maintainable. I strive to hone my skills and I am hungry to learn,
experiment, and create. To see what I'm up to of what tools I use checkout my

#### Fitness
I was a competitive swimmer for over 10 years and dabbled in, water polo, rugby,
power lifting, Olympic lifting and strongman. These days I ride my bike wherever
I can, jump in lakes when the weathers nice, and do body weight exercise.
